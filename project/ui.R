For many years, there has been ongoing demand and concerns regarding inclusivity in the beauty industry. It is common knowledge, how diversity is glaringly insufficient and undesirable in today's progressive society. The darker shades of foundation on the color spectrum are usually limited and not many people of color have access to a wider range of shades within their skin tone. Despite people of color perpetually voicing their concerns about the lack of diversity. Unfortunately, many well-known brands disregard these claims and instead, they consistently cater to a lighter range of skin tones. No matter how many times consumers raise their voices, it has become apparent that disregarding the inclusivity of a certain population is a very detrimental oversight. Considering the fact that customers can wield their purchasing power anytime for a change. After many years, now the beauty industry is slowly evolving and some changes have been pioneered with brands like Fenty Beauty. Especially brands like Fenty Beauty a Black-owned brand, is known for advocating for inclusivity and her foundation ranges are more diverse than any other brands."),

While the data set provides us with a good starting point it still leaves us with limitations and challenges regarding the foundation colors and companies that they have analyzed. Another challenge that arises with our dataset is that there is a lack of visual representation of the shade colors they evaluated This makes it less accessible, as hue and saturation are not common knowledge when customers are shopping for foundation shades. The insufficiency of a visual presence for the foundation colors can hinder the understanding of the diversity and inclusivity of these brands’ shade ranges. This would also pose a challenge in assessing the diversity and inclusivity of the brand's foundation shades when we are not able to analyze further and identify if undertone and skin tones play a role in the shade ranges they have included in their dataset."),

For example, in the dataset, Mac has more significant brands of foundation that appear to be lighter and one shade that is the darkest. Additionally, in this dataset, the brand Mac appears to cater to more lighter skin color people instead of having an equal distribution of shades of all people of color like Fenty. If you just select the brand Fenty in the dataset, you can see how diverse Rihanna a black owned celebrity foundation appears to be.
