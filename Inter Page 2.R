The range is greater for Fenty foundations hues as well. The wider hue range implies that thereâ€™s inclusivity and broader skin tones are accommodated. A variety of skin tones can be matched with a wider hue range. Hence Fenty, having a wider hue range, is able to have foundation shades that match more skin tones.")
